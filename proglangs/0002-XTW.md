## Syntax

```
*:
  the lexer splits tokens at spaces.
    $token1 ' ' $token2

  A comment starts with '//' that goes to the end of the line.

  STR = strings:
    can contain spaces, escape sequences and escaped double-quotes
    are delimited by double-quotes
  e.g.
    "any more"

  non-terminals
    ID   [a-z]+
    INT  (0|[1-9][0-9]*)

  $command = commands are separated by ';'

*specified:
    $label(ID)

function call:
  call function beginning at label, the different handling of syntax for
  "no arguments" is needed to distinguish between call ($label) and expand ($variable)

    $label '(' $arguments? ')'

function definition:
    'f' $label $arguments? '{' $command* '}'

$expression:
  expressions are used within lines of code as conditions or arguments.
  They could be enclosed in ()s (parentheses). An example of an expression
  is 4 > 5 or A + 5. The expression will return a value. You can nest these.

conditionals:
    '(' $condition ')' '{' $command+ '}'

labels:
  labels are special commands, because because they don't have a semi-colon
  as separator, but a colon:
    $label~':'
```

## Operators

```
argument operator:
  this is a nullnary operator which fetches the next command line argument
  and shifts (implicit argv)
    'a'

casting operator:
    'c' $type $expression

plugin operator:
  this operator loads an shared object as plugin into memory and returns a
  reference (to the plugin descriptor)
    'i' $plugin(STR)
```
